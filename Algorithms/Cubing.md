This course was not my first experience with cubing but I did learn a lot more about the activity throughout this semester. 
While previously I had just memorized algorithms I had found online, challenges such as "solve this in 4 moves or less" really got me thinking about the relationships and logic behind solving these puzzles.
Now that I am able to solve a 3x3 and Pyramix, I hope to tackle other puzzles such as a 4x4 in the future.
